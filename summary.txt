Assumptions I made: 

I assumed this was a supermarket- like a Walmart. 

Based on my experiences at walmart I assumed these values:

    - most people are getting between 2-20 items
    - it takes around 1 min and 15s to find each item (walmart is a pretty big store)
    - I kept that a chashier can scan 10 items a minute with at least 1 min per customer
    - A new customer arrives every minute (its a popular place) 

After adjusting and playing with the number of checkers, items people get, 
and how long it takes to get each item, I came up with these conclusions:

    - If there are too few checkers, the wait time for consumers grows very quickly
    - Having more checkers does reduce the customer's wait time, but it also greatly increases
        the idle time of the cashiers
    - Overall, there has to be a balance of both a reasonable wait time and reasonable idletime. 

    Based on the conditions I provided in my assumptions, I recommend 3 checkers
     to keep the idle time, wait time, and max wait time acceptable.
